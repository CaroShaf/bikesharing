# CitiBikes-NYC Comes to Des Moines?
Data analysis was conducted on the CitiBikes bike sharing program in Manhattan to see what insights could be gleaned and applied to a proposed bike sharing program in Des Moines,
IA.  Several factors were studied.  They included demographics of customers, time of day of highest use of bikes and weekday usage.  Subscriber vs customer (tourist) usage was
also considered.  A presentation was created for potential investors.

## Resources:  
CSV file from CitiBikes on NYC data (converted through Pandas/Python), CSV file (created) of Des Moines attractions, Tableau Public

## Results:
At the Tableau Public story link provided here:

Visualizations show that that patterns of behavior by age and gender of bike riders in NYC could very well be similar to Des Moines.  There are many differences, though, also,
which need to be fully explored.  Also, a throughout inventory of tourist attractions (which is started here with a map 20 attractions within less than 2 miles of the Capitol)
and accommodations should be made of Des Moines, as well as consideration of the level of subscriber potential/commuters in Des Moines, as compared to NYC.

## Summary:
Des Moines has many attractions and features that could make a bike share program successful.  However, potential investors will want to see more studies before committing to
this project.

Additional future visualizations include: 
1.) A comparison of number of cyclists (as a percentage) in NYC to Des Moines

2.) A comparison of other Iowa cities'(or other similarly sized cities) bike share programs: (obtaining data from those cities)
  a.) Mason City - https://visitmasoncityiowa.com/whats-new/bike-share-program/
  b.) Iowa City - https://www.kjan.com/index.php/2019/09/iowa-city-is-latest-community-to-launch-a-bike-sharing-program/
  c.) Cedar Rapids - https://www.iowapublicradio.org/2019-05-13/cedar-rapids-rolls-out-bike-share-program
  
3.) General tourism and bike communting statistics should be conducted to see how far people typically travel to Des Moines as a destination, vs. NYC which is a destination for international travelers

4.) Comparison of "walk/bike scores" along with comprehensive bike trail/bike lane maps of Des Moines  (https://www.walkscore.com/score/manhattan-ny)
